 * The Normalizer's purpose is to transform any word from any

 *
 * The most common normalization would be to transform the words to
 * lower case. There are languages though that this is not enough
 * since there maybe other diacritics that need to be removed.
 *
 * E.g.: The         -> the
 *       I           -> i
 *       WhAtEvEr    -> whatever
 *       Άγγελος     -> αγγελοσ
 *       Αριστοτέλης -> αριστοτελησ
